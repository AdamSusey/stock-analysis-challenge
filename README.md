# Module 2 Challenge!

# Overview

After performing an analysis for a friend of mine to better understand a group of stocks performance over the years, I realized that there might be a better way. This challenge is about getting the smae results but in a more condensed, bit size matter to reduce runtime required by the computer.

# Results

After hours of troubleshooting, I was able to increase the performance of the macro greatly. Below are screenshots to show how quickly it will run when you interact with the button assigned to it.

# Summary

## What are the advantages of refactoring code?

> Increasing performance can greatly improve usability in the real world. While the difference in this example is quite small, the process can still be applied to a much larger file.

## What are the disadvantages of refactoring code?

> While the performance gained can be very nice, the time spent getting those improvements should be taken accounted for. Time vs Performance!
